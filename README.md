# Temperature_in_Microdroplet_under_Bessel_beam
Calculate the time-dependent and spatial temperature distribution in a microdroplet heated by a pulsed Bessel beam with or without considering the refraction of the droplets.
## Model discription
The calculation is based on heat conduction model in Spherical coordinates using integral transformation or Green's function. The boundary condition at the droplet surface is assumed to be heat convection boundary condition with fixed heat convection coefficient. Thus, all the boundary conditions are homogeneous. However, the governing equation is nonhomogeneous with interal heating *g(r,\theta)*
